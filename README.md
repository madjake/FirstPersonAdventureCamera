# First Person Adventure Camera

A mod that automatically keeps you in First Person Mode while playing World of Warcraft.  

## Download & Install

Curse Forge: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/first-person-adventure-camera

## Commands

`/fpa` to toggle on and off

`/fpa hardcore` toggle on and off hardcore mode which keeps you in First Person during combat

`/fpa reset` reset to default

## How it works

By default, when you are playing World of Warcraft it will keep your camera zoomed into First Person mode.  When you 
enter combat it will unlock the camera and zoom out. This is because many classes have aggressive particle effects
and it's quite hard to track during combat. 

You can toggle on "hardcore" mode  with `/fpa hardcore` which will keep you in first person during combat.

## Why

It can be a lot more immersive as scale and detail is a lot easier to notice!
